   The celluloid torch has been passed to a new
generation: filmmakers who grew up in the 1960s.
   ``Platoon,'' ``Running on Empty,'' ``1969'' and ``Mississippi
Burning'' are among the movies released in the past two years from
writers and directors who brought their own experiences of that
turbulent decade to the screen.
   ``The contemporaries of the '60s are some of the filmmakers of
the '80s. It's natural,'' said Robert Friedman, the senior vice
president of worldwide advertising and publicity at Warner Bros.
   Chris Gerolmo, who wrote the screenplay for ``Mississippi
Burning,'' noted that the sheer passage of time has allowed him and
others to express their feelings about the decade.
   ``Distance is important,'' he said. ``I believe there's a lot of
thinking about that time and America in general.''
   The Vietnam War was a defining experience for many people in the
'60s, shattering the consensus that the United States had a right,
even a moral duty to intervene in conflicts around the world. Even
today, politicians talk disparagingly of the ``Vietnam Syndrome'' in
referring to the country's reluctance to use military force to
settle disputes.
   ``I think future historians will talk about Vietnam as one of the
near destructions of American society,'' said Urie Brofenbrenner, a
professor of sociology at Cornell University.
   ``In World War II, we knew what we were fighting for, but not in
Vietnam.''
   ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ``Gardens of Stone,'' ``Platoon,'' ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Hamburger Hill'' and ``Bat 21'' all use the
war as a dramatic backdrop and show how it shaped characters' lives.
   The Vietnam War has remained an emotional issue in the United
States as veterans have struggled to come to terms with their
experiences. One was Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the
Academy Award-winning ``Platoon.''
   ``I saw `Platoon' eight times,'' said John J. Anderson, a Palm
Beach County sheriff's lieutenant who served in Vietnam in 1966-67.
``I cried the first time I saw it ... and the third and fourth
times. `Platoon' helped me understand.''
   Stone, who based ``Platoon'' on some of his own experiences as a
grunt, said the film brought up issues that had yet to be resolved.
   ``People are responding to the fact that it's real. They're
curious about the war in Vietnam after 20 years,'' he said.
   While Southeast Asia was the pivotal foreign issue in American
society of the '60s, civil rights was the major domestic issue. The
civil rights movement reached its peak in the ``Freedom Summer'' of
1964, when large groups of volunteers headed South to help register
black voters.
   In ``Five Corners,'' a movie about the summer of '64 in the Bronx
starring Jodie Foster, her friend, played by Tim Robbins, leaves his
neighborhood to volunteer in the South after seeing the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. on television.
   Alan Parker's ``Mississippi Burning'' focuses on an incident that
clouded the Mississippi Summer Project _ when 1,000 young volunteers
from mainstream America swept into the state to help register black
voters. The movie is a fictionalized account of the disappearance
and slaying of three civil rights workers: Michael Schwerner, Andrew
Goodman and James Chaney.
   They were reported missing on June 21, several hours after being
stopped for speeding near Philadelphia, Miss. After a nationally
publicized search, their bodies were discovered Aug. 4 on a farm
just outside the town.
   One of those who recalled the incident was Gerolmo, a student in
the New York public school system at the time. The screenwriter said
the incident had a powerful effect on his way of thinking.
   ``It was the first time I ever considered that our country could
be wrong,'' Gerolmo said.
   The film stars Willem Dafoe and Gene Hackman star as FBI agents
who try to find the bodies of the missing workers and overcome
fierce local resistance to solve the crime.
   In a more offbeat and outrageous way, John Waters' ``Hairspray''
discusses integration in Baltimore in 1963 when a group of
teen-agers tries to break down the barriers of a segregated dance
show.
   Also set in Baltimore is Barry Levinson's ``Tin Men,'' starring
Danny DeVito and Richard Dreyfuss as two slick aluminum siding
salesmen in the early '60s. The movie mirrored a squarely
middle-class culture, one that was not caught up in sex, politics
and drugs.
   Instead of focusing on a well-known historic event,
writer-director Ernest Thompson takes a more personal approach in
``1969.'' Robert Downey Jr. and Keifer Sutherland star as college
students who battle their parents and each other over sex, drugs and
the Vietnam War.
   ``I was 19 in 1969. It was a fulcrum time for me,'' said
Thompson, who was a student at American University at the time. ``I
think it was just the right time in my growth as an artist and as a
man to try to write about something that happened in my youth.''
   ``Running on Empty'' takes place in the '80s but the '60s are
much in evidence. Judd Hirsch and Christine Lahti play anti-war
activists who sabatoged a napalm plant in 1970 and are forced to
live underground with their two children.
   Naomi Foner, who wrote ``Running on Empty'' and also served as
the film's executive producer, grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., the
daughter of sociologists. Her own experiences made Foner well
qualified to give ``Running on Empty'' its strong political theme.
   ``I lived through that time and I've wanted to find the right way
to present it to this generation,'' said Foner, a member of the
radical Students for a Democratic Society while attending graduate
school at Columbia University.
   Foner, who also taught in Harlem's Head Start program and helped
register voters in South Carolina, said many young people are
curious about what happened in the '60s.
   ``A lot of them think it was an exciting time that they were
sorry to have missed,'' she said.
   Brofenbrenner said movies are a good indicator of the concerns of
the general public: ``The principle impact of the media is that they
reflect the values of the larger society.
   ``Film is a very powerful art medium,'' he said. ``I believe it
very accurately reflects not only the prevailing but the coming
trends. It's because film writers, like other writers, are
perceptive people. They get the message of what's going on.''

   For students working in a miniature factory at
the University of Missouri-Rolla, the future of American business is
now.
   ``When our students go into industry, they will have
state-of-the-art knowledge'' that will affect decisions about
expanding the role of robots and automated machines in the
workplace, said Sema Alptekin, designer of the futuristic business
laboratory.
   Ms. Alptekin is a mechanical and industrial engineer who directs
the university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaging
laboratory.
   The lab, established two years ago at a cost of $120,000, is the
only project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advanced
such programs in the country.
   Tom Akas of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers said Ms.
Alptekin has created ``a model for similar laboratories ... Students
can see how the factory of the future operates.''
   The Society of Manufacturing Engineers has recognized Ms.
Alptekin as an Outstanding Young Manufacturing Engineer.
   In her lab, a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from
storage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent,
4-foot metal sentry. The robot is a V-shaped, jointed arm on a
pivoting base. The arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp, lift and
turn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks. The
robot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe
or milling machine.
   The entire factory would fit inside a basketball half-court. The
machinery is of the type used to make small parts in metal cutting
shops, Ms. Alptekin said.
   Students learn to program a computer and automated machines
linked to it in a complete manufacturing operation _ retrieving raw
materials from the storage shelf unit, which can be programmed to
supply appropriate parts from its inventory; lifting and placing the
parts in position with the robot's arm; and shaping parts into
finished products at the lathe.
   Students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key
chains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass.
   But the product is less important than the process. Ms. Alptekin
said former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation
and financial consulting.
   In the factory of the future, according to the university's
model, human chatter will be replaced by the click-clack of machines.
   ``Ours is quite unique, it's totally integrated,'' Ms. Alptekin
said, referring to programming that allows components such as the
automated storage system to ``talk to'' the computer that controls
the manufacturing process, informing it about the availability of
parts.
   Ms. Alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even
from industries where robots and automated machines have become
almost commonplace. There, she said, robots perform specific tasks
in ``islands of automation,'' but human workers remain responsible
for keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the
production line.
   Ms. Alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobile
industry, but she would like to see it expanded.
   ``It should be used in any industry,'' she said. ``It's difficult
to justify economically, but if quality is the concern, then it can
be easily justified.
   ``At least our students will be aware of the enhancements and
developments in this area, and when they make decisions as engineers
and managers, they will take this into consideration,'' she said.
   A master's candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to
altering it to create a new product. Ms. Alptekin said the student
identified what new production components were necessary and
determined how they could be integrated into the system.
   A doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will
allow the system to diagnose itself. The system could be programmed
to recognize when a component is not working, and then decide to
switch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled
component, much as human managers would react.
   Graduate student Bob Borchelt said the equipment he is using is
on the cutting edge of manufacturing.
   ``Truthfully, I can't say that I was expecting this level of
expertise,'' he said. ``I know that our lab is one of the best of
its kind in an educational institution.''
   The lab, like the entire engineering management program, calls on
computing, mechanical, electrical and chemical skills _ and teamwork.
   ``For us, for managers, the entire system is important,'' Ms.
Alptekin said.
   Ms. Alptekin said she is continually fine-tuning the lab. This
past year, the original robot was replaced with one able to perform
more tasks. She now is considering purchasing a robot with vision
sophisticated enough to act as an inspector.
   The university spent $30,000 to upgrade lab equipment in 1987. An
estimated $60,000 to $70,000 was earmarked in 1988.
   International Business Machines Corp. recently pledged $1.2
million in computer equipment and software to the university as part
of an IBM program to aid 48 college-based robotics labs across the
country.
   ``Studies show that there's a severe national shortage of
instructional materials in this growing and critical area,'' said
Andy Russell, a spokesman for IBM. ``IBM will benefit because we
will be helping to train the (computer-integrated manufacturing)
workers and decision makers of today and tomorrow.''
